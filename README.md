**Abstract**

Denial of Service (DoS) attacks pose a significant threat to network security, disrupting services by overwhelming systems with excessive traffic. This paper presents a beginner-friendly DoS attack detection tool that monitors network traffic patterns, identifies anomalies, and alerts users in real-time. The tool provides an intuitive interface, enabling users with minimal technical expertise to detect and respond to potential attacks. By employing threshold-based anomaly detection, it ensures accessibility and efficiency in securing digital environments.

**Introduction**

With the growing reliance on digital infrastructure, the threat of DoS attacks has increased significantly. These attacks exploit vulnerabilities in networked systems, causing severe disruptions to businesses, organizations, and individuals. Traditional DoS detection mechanisms often require advanced technical knowledge, making them inaccessible to beginners. This paper introduces a DoS attack detection tool designed for ease of use, equipping users with a simple yet effective solution for network security monitoring. By analyzing network traffic and detecting abnormal patterns, the tool provides real-time alerts, allowing users to take immediate action against potential threats.

**Working of the Tool**

The DoS attack detection tool operates by continuously monitoring network traffic and analyzing patterns over a defined time window. The key components include:

1. **Traffic Monitoring**: The tool collects network traffic data in real-time, simulating packet flow to establish normal traffic behavior.
2. **Threshold-Based Detection**: A pre-defined threshold is set to identify unusual spikes in network traffic. If the average traffic exceeds this threshold within a specific period, it triggers an alert.
3. **Real-Time Alerts**: Upon detecting an anomaly, the tool generates a warning notification to inform users of potential DoS activity.
4. **User Interface**: The tool features a simple GUI, displaying traffic statistics and providing control options for starting and stopping the monitoring process.

By leveraging these functionalities, the tool enhances network security by enabling early detection and mitigation of DoS attacks. The implementation ensures a balance between simplicity and effectiveness, making cybersecurity more accessible to beginners.

This paper further explores the system design, implementation details, and practical applications of the tool, demonstrating its utility in real-world scenarios.
